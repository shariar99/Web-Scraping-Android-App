This Android application demonstrates web scraping functionality using the Jsoup library. It allows you to scrape data from a movie website and display the movie titles, release dates, and corresponding images in a dynamic layout.

Additionally, it utilizes image downloading asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.

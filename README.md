This Android application demonstrates web scraping functionality using the Jsoup library. It allows you to scrape data from a movie website and display the movie titles, release dates, and corresponding images in a dynamic layout. The app leverages an AsyncTask to perform the web scraping in the background, ensuring a smooth user experience. Additionally, it utilizes image downloading asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.
